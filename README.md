## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Python 3.13 via Homebrew**:
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not already installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python 3.13
brew install python@3.13
```

2. **Install uv package manager**:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Setup with uv (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oldboldpilot/ClusterSetupAndConfigs.git
cd ClusterSetupAndConfigs

# IMPORTANT: On WSL, the Windows filesystem (/mnt/z, /mnt/c, etc.) doesn't support symlinks
# uv needs to store the virtual environment in your Linux home directory

# Set environment variable to use home directory for venv
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv/cluster-setup

# Sync dependencies (this will create the venv and install packages)
uv sync

# To run scripts with this environment
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv/cluster-setup
uv run python cluster_setup.py --help
```

**Add to your shell profile for persistence** (optional but recommended):
```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
echo 'export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv/cluster-setup' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Alternative: Using venv directly

### Important: Run from Master Node

**The script MUST be run from the master node** specified in your YAML config file. The script automatically detects which node it's running on by checking local IP addresses.

- If you run from the master node, it will set up all worker nodes automatically
- If you run from a worker node, it will only configure that local worker

Check which node you're on with:
```bash
ip addr show | grep inet
```

Compare the output with your master_ip in the config file.

If you encounter issues with uv on WSL:

```bash
# Ensure Python 3.13 is available
python3.13 --version

# Create a virtual environment in home directory (avoids WSL symlink issues)
python3.13 -m venv --copies ~/.venv/cluster-setup

# Activate the environment
source ~/.venv/cluster-setup/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python cluster_setup.py --help
```

### Troubleshooting WSL/uv Issues

**Problem**: `Operation not permitted (os error 1)` when creating venv

**Solution**: WSL can't create symlinks on Windows filesystems. Always use:
- `export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv/cluster-setup` before running `uv sync`
- Or create venv in Linux home directory with `python3.13 -m venv --copies`

**Problem**: `python3.13` not found

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check if Python 3.13 is installed via Homebrew
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3.13 --version

# Add Homebrew to PATH
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Or use full path
uv python pin /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3.13
```

## Usage

### üìñ Complete Documentation

For detailed deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and best practices, see:
- **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive deployment and usage guide

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirement: Run from Master Node

**The script MUST be executed from the master node** specified in your configuration file. The script automatically detects which node it's running on by checking local IP addresses.

Check your current node:
```bash
# See all your local IP addresses
ip addr show | grep "inet "

# The output should include the master_ip from your config file
```

### Configuration File

The script requires a YAML configuration file containing cluster node information.

Create a configuration file (e.g., `cluster_config.yaml`):

```yaml
master_ip: "192.168.1.147"
worker_ips:
  - "192.168.1.137"
  - "192.168.1.96"
username: "muyiwa"
```

### Automatic Full Cluster Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to setup your entire cluster is to run the script **once** on the master node with the `--password` flag:

```bash
python cluster_setup.py --config cluster_config.yaml --password
```

You'll be prompted to enter the password for the worker nodes. The script will then:
1. Setup the master node completely
2. Generate and copy SSH keys to all worker nodes
3. **Automatically connect to each worker node via SSH**
4. **Run the full setup on each worker node remotely**
5. Configure the entire cluster end-to-end

This means you **only need to run the command once** on the master node, and the entire cluster will be configured automatically!

#### How to Know When Setup is Complete

**Command Line:**
- The script will print a final summary with "CLUSTER SETUP SUMMARY"
- Look for: `‚úì Master node setup completed` and `‚úì All worker nodes setup completed automatically`
- The script will return to the command prompt when done

**UI (cluster_setup_ui.py):**
- A notification will appear: "‚úì Cluster setup completed!"
- The log will show: `‚úì SETUP PROCESS COMPLETED` with a banner
- The "Setup Cluster" button will be re-enabled
- You'll see a message: "The cluster setup script has finished executing"

### Manual Setup (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to setup each node manually, or if automatic setup fails:

```bash
# On master node
python cluster_setup.py --config cluster_config.yaml

# Then manually on each worker node
python cluster_setup.py --config cluster_config.yaml
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
# View all available options
python cluster_setup.py --help

# Required:
--config, -c           Path to YAML configuration file

# Optional:
--password, -p         Prompt for password to automatically setup the entire cluster
                       (copies SSH keys + runs setup on all worker nodes remotely)

--non-interactive      Run in non-interactive mode (skip confirmation prompts)
                       Automatically used for worker nodes during remote setup
```

### Complete Example

For a cluster with:
- Master node: 192.168.1.147
- Worker nodes: 192.168.1.137, 192.168.1.96
- Username: muyiwa

1. **Verify you're on the master node**:
```bash
ip addr show | grep "inet " | grep 192.168.1.147
# Should see output if you're on the master node
```

2. Create `cluster_config.yaml`:
```yaml
master_ip: "192.168.1.147"
worker_ips:
  - "192.168.1.137"
  - "192.168.1.96"
username: "muyiwa"
```

3. Run on master node with automatic full cluster setup:
```bash
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv/cluster-setup
uv run python cluster_setup.py --config cluster_config.yaml --password
# Enter password when prompted
# The script will automatically:
#   - Detect you're on the master node
#   - Setup the master node completely
#   - Copy SSH keys to workers
#   - Setup all worker nodes remotely
#   - Configure the entire cluster
```

3. Verify the setup:
```bash
# Test Slurm
sinfo

# Test OpenMPI (local only)
mpirun -np 2 hostname

# Test parallel execution across cluster with pdsh
brew install pdsh
pdsh -w 192.168.1.[147,137,96] hostname
```

## What the Script Does

The cluster setup script performs the following operations:

1. **Node Detection**: Automatically detects if running on master or worker node by comparing local IPs
2. **Homebrew Installation**: Installs Homebrew package manager on Ubuntu/WSL
3. **SSH Setup**: 
   - Installs OpenSSH client and server
   - Generates SSH keys for passwordless authentication
   - Automatically copies SSH keys to worker nodes (with `--password` flag)
   - Uses secure password handling via stdin piping (no command-line exposure)
4. **Automatic Worker Setup** (when run from master with `--password`):
   - Creates wrapper scripts for sudo password handling
   - Copies setup script and config to each worker via SSH
   - Remotely executes full setup on all worker nodes
   - Monitors progress and reports any errors
5. **Hosts File Configuration**: Updates `/etc/hosts` with all cluster node information
6. **Slurm Installation**: Installs Slurm workload manager via Homebrew
7. **OpenMPI Installation**: Installs OpenMPI for parallel computing
8. **Slurm Configuration**: 
   - Creates necessary directories (`/var/spool/slurm`, `/var/log/slurm`, etc.)
   - Generates `slurm.conf` with cluster topology
   - Configures cgroup support
   - Starts Slurm services (slurmctld on master, slurmd on all nodes)
9. **OpenMPI Configuration**: 
   - Creates MPI hostfile with all cluster nodes
   - Configures MCA parameters
10. **Verification**: Tests all installed components

## Post-Installation Steps

After running the script on all nodes:

1. **Verify SSH connectivity**:
```bash
ssh worker1  # Should connect without password
```

2. **Check Slurm status**:
```bash
sinfo          # View node status
scontrol show nodes  # Detailed node information
```

3. **Test MPI**:
```bash
mpirun -np 4 -hostfile ~/.openmpi/hostfile hostname
```

4. **Submit a test Slurm job**:
```bash
srun -N 2 hostname
```

## Configuration Files

The script creates and manages the following configuration files:

- `/etc/hosts` - Cluster node hostnames and IPs
- `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf` - Slurm cluster configuration
- `/etc/slurm/cgroup.conf` - Cgroup configuration for Slurm
- `~/.openmpi/hostfile` - OpenMPI node list
- `~/.openmpi/mca-params.conf` - OpenMPI parameters
- `~/.ssh/config` - SSH client configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Node Detection Issues

**Problem**: Script says "Current node is: WORKER" when you expected MASTER

**Cause**: Local IP addresses don't match the `master_ip` in config

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what the script detects
ip addr show | grep "inet "

# Look for debug output in script:
# DEBUG: hostname='...', local_ip='...', master_ip='...'
# DEBUG: Found IPs on interfaces: [...]

# If your master IP isn't listed, either:
# 1. Update the config file with correct master_ip
# 2. Run the script from the actual master node
```

### SSH Issues

If passwordless SSH is not working:
```bash
# Ensure the public key is in authorized_keys on all nodes
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Test SSH manually
ssh -v worker1  # -v for verbose debugging
```

### Sudo Password Issues

**Problem**: `sudo: no password was provided` or lock file errors

**Solution**: The script now uses secure stdin piping. If issues persist:
```bash
# Verify sudo access
sudo -l

# Wait for other apt processes
sudo fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
# If process found, wait for it to complete
```

### Slurm Service Issues

**Problem**: Slurm services fail to start with errors like:
- `Incorrect permissions on state save loc: /var/spool/slurm/ctld`
- `The option "CgroupAutomount" is defunct`
- `Unable to determine this slurmd's NodeName`

**Solution**:

1. **Fix deprecated CgroupAutomount option** (Slurm 24.11+):
```bash
# Remove the deprecated option from cgroup.conf
sudo sed -i '/CgroupAutomount/d' /etc/slurm/cgroup.conf
```

2. **Fix directory permissions** (must be owned by slurm user):
```bash
sudo chown -R slurm:slurm /var/spool/slurm/ctld
sudo chown -R slurm:slurm /var/spool/slurm/d
sudo chown -R slurm:slurm /var/log/slurm
```

3. **Fix hostname mismatch** (slurm.conf must use actual hostname):
```bash
# Check your actual hostname
hostname

# Update slurm.conf to use actual hostname instead of "master"
# Edit /etc/slurm/slurm.conf and replace:
#   NodeName=master -> NodeName=ACTUAL-HOSTNAME
#   SlurmctldHost=master -> SlurmctldHost=ACTUAL-HOSTNAME
```

4. **Restart Slurm services**:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart slurmctld  # On master only
sudo systemctl restart slurmd     # On all nodes

# Check status
systemctl status slurmctld
systemctl status slurmd

# Test
sinfo
```

**Note**: The latest version of the script (as of October 2025) automatically handles these issues on both master and worker nodes. When workers are set up automatically via SSH, they receive the same configuration fixes.

**Worker Node Setup**: When using the `--password` flag on the master, worker nodes automatically receive:
- Correct master hostname in slurm.conf (fetched via SSH from master)
- Fixed cgroup.conf without deprecated options
- Proper directory permissions for Slurm services
- Systemctl service management

### OpenMPI 5.x and PRRTE Cross-Cluster Issues

**Known Issue**: OpenMPI 5.x may have difficulty executing across remote nodes due to PRRTE daemon communication and port requirements.

**Symptoms**:
- `mpirun` with `--host` or `--hostfile` hangs after SSH connection
- Works fine locally but not across nodes
- SSH connectivity works, but MPI programs don't execute

**Root Cause**: OpenMPI 5.x uses **PRRTE (PMIx Reference Runtime Environment)** for process management, which requires:
1. Bidirectional network communication between all nodes
2. Multiple TCP ports for daemon communication (not just SSH port 22)
3. Proper firewall configuration to allow OOB (out-of-band) communication

**What is PRRTE?**
- PRRTE is the runtime daemon system used by OpenMPI 5.x (replaces the older ORTE)
- Commands: `prte` (start DVM), `prted` (daemon), `prun` (run programs in DVM)
- Requires ports for PMIx and OOB TCP communication between nodes
- Installed automatically with OpenMPI 5.x via Homebrew

**Port Requirements**:
The script now configures the following ports in `~/.openmpi/mca-params.conf`:
- **BTL TCP ports**: Starting from port 50000 (`btl_tcp_port_min_v4 = 50000`)
- **OOB TCP port range**: 50100-50200 (`oob_tcp_port_range = 50100-50200`)

**Firewall Configuration**:
If you have a firewall enabled (ufw, iptables, Windows Firewall), you must allow these ports:
```bash
# On Ubuntu/WSL with ufw (if enabled)
sudo ufw allow 50000:50200/tcp comment 'OpenMPI PRRTE'
```

For WSL specifically, Windows Firewall may also need configuration to allow these ports.

**Network Interface Configuration Fixed**: The script originally hardcoded `btl_tcp_if_include = eth0`, but:
- eth0 is often DOWN on many systems
- The actual cluster network is typically on eth1 or other interfaces
- **Solution**: Script now auto-detects the correct network interface and uses IP ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) instead of interface names for better reliability

**Workaround - Use pdsh for Parallel Execution**:

```bash
# Install pdsh
brew install pdsh

# Run commands across all nodes
pdsh -w 192.168.1.[147,137,96] hostname

# Execute Python scripts in parallel
pdsh -w 192.168.1.[147,137,96] 'python3 /path/to/script.py'

# Run with custom SSH options
pdsh -R exec -w 192.168.1.[137,96] command
```

**pdsh Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Simple and reliable parallel execution
- ‚úÖ Works immediately with existing SSH setup
- ‚úÖ No complex daemon or network requirements
- ‚úÖ Perfect for embarrassingly parallel tasks

**Verifying PRRTE Installation**:
```bash
# Check PRRTE is installed
prte --version
prun --version

# View configured MPI ports
cat ~/.openmpi/mca-params.conf
```

**For True MPI Programs**:
- **Best option**: Use Slurm's `srun` instead of `mpirun` (Slurm handles process management)
- **Alternative**: Test with OpenMPI 4.x which uses older orted mechanism (less port-dependent)
- **WSL-specific**: Windows port forwarding only forwards SSH port 22, not the dynamic MPI ports
- **Debugging**: Add `--mca btl_base_verbose 20 --mca oob_base_verbose 10` to mpirun for detailed logging
- Ensure all required ports (50000-50200) are open in firewalls on all nodes
